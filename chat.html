For pure sales, where you have SDRs and they need to run drip campaigns/calling - close does the job.\n\nWhen more marketing functions come into play viz lead capture via forms, landing pages, chatbots - Hubspot is better.\n[2:41 pm, 30/04/2024] +91 97114 33285: Do we have better credits for GitLab\n[6:36 pm, 30/04/2024] +91 97114 33285: Hi Folks, is there a way to avail free Linear credits?\n[6:38 pm, 30/04/2024] +91 97114 33285: I just checked - https://linear.app/startups/partners\n[6:38 pm, 30/04/2024] +91 97114 33285: Can we do this, please @Vaibhav Domkundwar @+91 90003 48411\n[6:44 pm, 30/04/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Will do\n[6:45 pm, 30/04/2024] +91 97114 33285: Thanks!\n[7:18 am, 01/05/2024] +91 98202 25911: Hi everyone, at Hyperface we are looking for a VP Product, someone passionate about building b2b saas and experience in domains like Martech/ Fintech\n 10+ Years experience.\n[1:12 pm, 01/05/2024] +91 95820 09957: I am looking for roles in sales and operations particularly in post sales, CRM, KAM, etc in my last internship I led an endeavour which helped my company raise 125,000 $ plus I helped them on board more than a 1000 user in their test net phase.\nHey friends Ishika is looking for a finance/ data analysis internship.

This is mainly because most founders understand the value but don’t get time to do much OR think what they are doing is good enough. The latter is worse. Unless your are Adam’s level of activity, consistently and engagement it is just not good enough - this post is a good one for the “why” around investing time and effort into this: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/retentionadam_two-weeks-ago-scott-leese-told-me-activity-7192625365406638080-IyhY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\n\nOn the other hand, I am not seeing anything particularly working well fo…\n[4:19 pm, 07/05/2024] +91 98860 94355: Hey hey @+91 96371 18388 can you please share deets of the Sunday event.

RB2B Ids the exact visitor. Makes targeting orders of magnitude simpler.\n[3:56 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: yup - but only for US region today. It’s freakishly correct.\n[3:56 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: once you move to Apollo fully please share a simple block diagram on the workflow you've setup and share so those who want to try don't reinvent the wheel\n[3:57 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: RB2B is unreal - real time LI profiles of visitors in your slack! IF YOU ARE NOT USING IT OR DON\"T KNOW ABOUT IT, your GTM stack is not there yet :) especially everyone who has invested in SEO -- this tool can give your sales team SO much more actionable data.\n[3:58 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: This helps us a lot as well. Would recommend using Storylane. After they launched account Deanonymisation , it’s giving us a lot of data.\n[3:59 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: All this is in FREE plan. It’s insane.\n[4:01 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 91084 11038: i see - i guess they do a reverse lookup on the IP address and then try and guess the company? like most other such tools. you want to use such tools to target large companies anyway. so, just knowing the company isn't particularly useful\n[4:02 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: try RB2B for the exact contact details and see how well it works for you. US visitors only, for now.\n[4:02 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 98715 98223: They don't do reverse IP lookup. That reveals just account info. They work with ad networks who have individual level info and lookup that db to ID the visitor.\n[4:03 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Thanks to Rb2B :)\n[4:03 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 91084 11038: strongly endorse storylane too. we are on their free plan as well and find it very useful. we stopped in-person demos and have saved a lot of bandwidth\n[4:04 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: i've said that follow-up should be slightly delayed -- did u LI message him?\n[4:04 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Yes, Li messaged him.\n[4:05 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: According to Rb2b founder, much better conversion if you reach out to them immediately. We followed his advise 🙂\n[4:07 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 96739 93655: Insane thread. 🙇‍♂️😎Signed up to RB2B, connected slack & integrated code.\n[4:08 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Yes takes a few mins at most ..\n[4:09 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 96739 93655: I read it only works for US based traffic. So no GDPR implications, I am assuming?\n[4:11 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: correct\n[4:19 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: I don’t know how many of you do this, but the biggest sales unlock for me has actually come from a super simple thing - \n\nHubspot Email tracking notification\n[4:25 pm, 08/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: for emails sent via hubspot OR even those sent directly one on one from your email client?\n[4:26 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Install hubspot chrome extension, works only with gmail As far as I know.\n[8:08 pm, 08/05/2024] +91 77387 84781: Hi guys, any recommendations for ESOP management tools?

Dming you\n[10:40 am, 09/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: bubbling this up for more B2B folks to answer ---- and please give RB2B a shot. with a couple of founders I will see if we can do a zoom to go over the setups that have worked well and are highly recommended, similar to the cold call one that we did with Rudra. please answer the poll\n[10:42 am, 09/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Equitylist\n[10:43 am, 09/05/2024] +91 91677 55780: We are using EquityList as well - it's about 40k per year, does the job.\n[10:44 am, 09/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Better has credits too guys, right?\n[10:44 am, 09/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: if not on the list I can check with Kashish and come back.\n[10:50 am, 09/05/2024] +91 91677 55780: yes it does. we weren't able to use - valid for <25 stakeholders. With angels, investors, employees with ESOPs - we were over the limit.\n[10:50 am, 09/05/2024] +91 91677 55780: with less than 25 stakeholders, equitylist is free via better credits\n[10:52 am, 09/05/2024] +91 77387 84781: Got it. Thank you!\n[10:56 am, 09/05/2024] +91 95558 55409: #GenuineAsk - On a side note, just out of curiosity - what is that platforms like EquityList can provide for, that a basic excel cannot ?

I've teamed up with a US based B2C SaaS company, and between influencer collaborations and re-marketing paid ads, it's been off the charts.\n\nThe key is nailing down the brand guidelines. Figuring out what content to push, where to push, the best times and days, what to put in titles and thumbnails, finding the right emotion for the content, which features to highlight, etc, it all adds up.\n\nUsually, you hear about the 80/ 20 rule that 20% of the influencer efforts bring in 80% of the results, but we've been hitting closer to 50% now. And it's super scalable. We 3x'ed the number of influencers we work with, and  3x'ed our new paid users and new MRR (over a substan…\n[6:33 pm, 12/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: yes - seeing this too. Phyllo - @+91 97997 19444 and Mezink - @+60 17-347 2475 @+91 70436 69577 -- have tons of data too. highly recommend everyone to explore and iterate to see if it works well for you.\n[6:38 pm, 12/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: HYPD - @+91 95558 55409 and WYLD - @+91 96192 23375 @+91 77387 84781 -- have incredible reach in the influencer ecosystem in India and between them i believe they'd know 80% of the folks that matter :) so wanted to highlight this too.\n[6:39 pm, 12/05/2024] +91 97306 69669: Can you share the Company name\n[6:43 pm, 12/05/2024] +91 98730 02814: Sorry am under a very strict NDA and hence can't :) I can delve more into it on DMs. I hope that's alright.\n[8:06 pm, 12/05/2024] +91 98730 02814: Got a lot of DMs, so sharing a few other things that may be beneficial to all, and what worked for me. This is only valid for B2C SAAS who have their primary customers in the US and European markets, but the concepts may be applied at large.\n\n1. Be very very nice to influencers. Make sure the relationship is great, but keep your offers low. Yes, you’ll hear a lot of “That offer is too low”. Yes it is and It’s ok. You’ll book 20% of the influencers you send an offer to, and that’s good enough.\n2. You will need to work with 50 different influencers across platforms to find the right mix. So, keep a budget of $50k to try this channel.\n3. ROI is 3x within the first 7 to 10 days of video going live. If you invest $1k, you should expect to make, on an average, $3k of re…\n[9:29 pm, 12/05/2024] +60 17-347 2475: This is amazing. Thank you for sharing.\n\n2 cents based on our experience working across ASEAN, India and UAE:\n\n- Creators from 10k-100k can work as good as 100k-500k. Everyone apart from guys > 1 Million has same effect and should optimise for top of the funnel (views, clicks etc)\n- Content guidance matters a lot: Same creator can give you 10x better return with intelligence in brief, script.\n- There is high price opacity and can vary by upto a factor 10 based on leverage (how long term the relationship is, is there additional variable pay etc)\n- Localisation works better than big names: Better to choose local language creator based on geography vs non local bigger creator.\n- Shares is a better marker of content performance than comments.\n[9:29 am, 13/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: can’t be more thankful to you all for continuing to share actionable insights … this is brilliant information and hopefully very actionable for many of you. \n\nthanks @+91 98730 02814 for kicking off this convo.\n[9:30 am, 13/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: this is also a good enough format for all of you to share what you believe is likely to be useful to all as and when it’s relevant / possible 🙏\n[8:48 pm, 13/05/2024] +91 95386 33833: Hi folks, we're setting up Stripe but have been stuck on their waiting list. Any clue how long this usually takes or any hacks to speed it up?\n[10:38 am, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: B2B US/Global Folks — exploring with a founder a service that brings together 10-20 buyers and 5 vendors for a brainstorm workshop/dinner so every vendor doesn’t have to reinvent it all and create a non-salesy dinner event. How much would you pay\n$3000 per event\n$5000 per event\n$7500 per event\nWe would want to do it ourselves\n[11:26 am, 14/05/2024] +91 88820 79208: Is there a way, we can understand how ai tools now can be used for our business, or can we have an expert session on that?\n[11:26 am, 14/05/2024] +91 88820 79208: If somebody is using it and is finding it very effective.\n[11:27 am, 14/05/2024] +91 88820 79208: As I understand, it will vary business to business, and a session together could help understand better.\n[11:40 am, 14/05/2024] +91 96199 66946: Took us 8-10 weeks\n[1:28 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 95357 22588: It’s tricky assuming you are registered only in India. \n\n If you’re looking to collect payments in India I’d suggest using an Indian payment gateway. To collect overseas payments (especially if b2b invoicing) you might want to check the equivalents of paddle (albeit pricey)\n[1:54 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 95386 33833: We also have a US parent entity, but we were looking to collect payments into our Indian sub. Will explore other Stripe alternatives and if it's easier/faster to do it with our US entity. Thanks!\n[1:59 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 99625 47309: If you are doing b2b invoicing and ticket sizes are not sub 200 dollars, but more in the few thousands of dollars, Skydo will work perfectly well for collecting payments in your india subsidiary\n[2:00 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 99625 47309: @~Movin Jain and I are founders of Skydo and can help you if this could work for you and you need more information\n[2:08 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 95386 33833: DMing you\n[2:20 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 97424 00802: Folks do we know anyone at CXO level at Delhivery ?\n[2:28 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 98730 02814: I think you can directly reach out to Sahil Barua (sb@delhivery.com). If it's useful for him, he'll reply. He reads all his emails and replies usually within 1 day.\n[2:39 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 97424 00802: Thank you\n[5:34 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 96503 97667: a q (could be dumb):\nif we are especially paying (thousands of dollars) to dine with potential buyers .. wouldn't the conversation get overly sales-y (rather than being less sales-y) cause you'd want to get something out of it?\n[5:38 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 96503 97667: mudit :)\nwe can chat if you'd like (been researching for a while now)\n\nalso, building 'ai&i' to better personal and workplace productivity\n[5:42 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: (1) apt for $50K ACV and onwards only (2) great way to engage and meet in a non-work environment (3) brainstorm, don’t sell (4) say you do it 5 times a year, that’s $25K approx to be in front of 50-100 potential decision makers who you’d not have access to as easily \n\nWhat I’m exploring is how one can build a service to enable this so it can scale and is a win-win-win.\n\nJust the time saved to get connected to the right people can mean a Series A that happens or not or is pushed longer.\n[5:43 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 88820 79208: Sure.\n[5:43 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 88820 79208: Let’s chat tomorrow 5pm?\n[5:55 pm, 14/05/2024] +49 1517 0015348: If you can get some of your existing customers in these dinners the selling will happen organically\n[6:02 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: yes the goal is to create value for those attending in terms of they meeting their peers too — and is a big deal. lots of b2b buyers crave this.\n[6:43 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 96503 97667: the most important part of this setting becomes how you curate the group of buyers and vendors? that are of significant value to each other (and the likelihood of something good happening, beyond an expensive dinner and drinks, is naturally high)\n[8:27 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Right now b2b vendors are simply cold emailing people to attend and getting whoever they can — verified from many. This is also for those who have tried this for a while and iterated — new folks will be worse off. \n\nThe reason is their other channels are worse off right now. \n\nSo any service that does better honestly should be great value added — and it will only get better over time than every vendor trying it themselves.\n[8:28 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: example - Topgolf will cost them more than $5000 and much more if lot of folks show up.\n[8:29 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Bumping this up so more folks can answer here — want as many as we can get from all B2B BFFs\n[8:53 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 96739 93655: One question - Why 5 vendors?  I am assuming they wont be from same space. 5 vendors might dilute the conversation & space vendor gets. As someone who have tried this (In Dubai, Mumbai & Pune), I would say its a lot of work to pull such events well. And I would be happy if available as a service. But execlusively to a particular vendor. 😅\n[8:54 pm, 14/05/2024] +91 96739 93655: We spent roughly 2K per event. So price point assuming US geo looks attractive.\n[10:06 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: will evolve with experience but the idea is to keep the group to 20-25 folks. and the 5 vendors is less vendors and more innovators who are building in the segment so its addictive to the convo from an innovation perspective than their own products. \n\nthink it is a better format to drive organic convos that are more trust building. \n\nLet’s see ..\n[10:11 pm, 14/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: the main thing is this: what sort of buyers are we getting access to right now and with what pace — right now this is terrible in most cases. \n\nas I spend more time on GTM the goal is to see what we can do to change this step by step.\n[8:23 am, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: my firm contra view on the India software ipo chatter - thanks to Pratyush, Ishaan and others for reviewing the drafts for feedback. \n\nhttps://x.com/vaibhavbetter/status/1790574801586708936?s=48\n[10:44 am, 15/05/2024] +91 96503 97667: to understand this better: \nwhy is it a 'this v that' debate, V? \n\nwhy can't going ipo in india be seen as one of the milestones to a much bigger ambition which founders often do? instead of seeing it as an ultimate destination (and therefore, a path full of mediocrity)\n[11:32 am, 15/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Folks this is a question on SEO:\n\nWhen intercom/hubspot gives you a chatbot that you embed on your website - does that also give these brands a backlink from your website?\n\nDoes anyone know?\n[11:43 am, 15/05/2024] +91 96503 97667: tl;dr - if you're using a paid plan, you can let go of their branding (the backlink that takes visitors to their website) ..\n[11:56 am, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: one has to make a US HQ or India HQ choice today because there are heavy tax implications of flipping later so the choice having to be made today is bringing this question to the forefront right now - even for very early-stage companies with early revenu. \n\nthere is another structure being explored but it has more unknowns than i am personally comfortable with.\n[11:58 am, 15/05/2024] +65 8180 6480: What about SG-US? Does one need to flip that too? Is it equally complex?\n[12:00 pm, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: SG companies wanting to do US IPO you mean? Dont know. \n\nSG to India flip is similar to US to India.\n[12:02 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 97114 33285: Can I ask a really dumb question? Why IPO? The pressures of being a public company are insane, no? And if you are not ready, the market will eat you up and forget about it. If private investors are brutal, public investors are a different beast all together.\n[12:08 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 72599 98836: Exactly my thought, these debates appear to assume IPO as the ultimate north star - why?\n[12:11 pm, 15/05/2024] +65 8180 6480: Will DM\n[12:11 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 97114 33285: Investor exits - Yes. But are there alternatives to that? What are other ways to get the same/similar outcome for investors?\n[12:12 pm, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: Why IPO — that was my very first objection when this first came up. I don’t get it. Largely investor-led …\n[12:14 pm, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: they are driven by investors who aren’t seeing IPO liquidity in their scaled companies — ipo is the best outcome for them. M&A is not. So structurally they want to ensure India ipo path is enabled right at the start as US bar is high and no one is meeting that bar from the last 15+ yrs on average.\n[12:15 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 97114 33285: Another dumb question - Why is M&A not the best outcome for them?\n[12:16 pm, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: multiple is lower - ipo is usually expected to be the highest multiple. retail investors :)\n[12:18 pm, 15/05/2024] +1 (310) 741-9361: Post by Gokul Rajaram\n[12:19 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 99308 51469: Vaibhav - will revisit after 5 yrs to see how this aged😊\n[12:20 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 98715 98223: Getting to a $100m SaaS business in India is an oxymoron! The markets here are just not deep enough to achieve that number. So if the bar for US IPOs has gone higher, shifting to India may not be the answer.\n[12:40 pm, 15/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: remember this is not for M2P like businesses with India as core market + anyone can always choose to go India ipo route and infact one of our founders who may do this - we are fully supportive .. but I’m pretty sure that if this becomes a trend then we will move further away from building globally relevant companies. and we are here in the first place in SaaS for example because we were building cheap alternatives and selling with cheap Indian SDRs .. this is the outcome (barely getting to 100m arr and not relevant in the US) that strategy was going to deliver — meanwhile in the same time Optimizely hit $400m ARR\n\nNo one right answer but we must understand where our choices will lead us — there is enough recent data. my post is mainly to highlight that :)\n[12:47 pm, 15/05/2024] +91 97306 69669: Requirement from a Bank: RM Scorecard / SOP simulator\nA leading private bank in India is looking for a technology partner to launch RM scorecard and SOP simulator  app in which RMs should be able to login and see their real time scorecard.

Such reverse flips also have tax consequences particularly in the USA in form of exit tax and anti-inversion rules. Hence the founders have to be mindful of creating a  flip/ crossborder/ Externalization structures, as GharWapsi can be a costly affair. Example Razorpay had to USD 100 mn in taxes in US on account of reverse flip PhonePe paid USD 1bn jn taxes on reverse flip .

But eventually settled to adapting Kotlin Multiplatform as it allowed to keep everything data in a common shared code base, and UI in the respective platform specific languages. We began doing all android UI in Compose Multiplatform so that when it goes production ready for iOS, we can make that switch too\n[11:52 am, 22/05/2024] +91 79754 12796: React Native had performance bottlenecks for our use case, which relies on low-level access for a more controlled low latency audio I/O\n[11:53 am, 22/05/2024] +91 79754 12796: Kotlin compiles natively to all platforms - so we don’t lose anything on performance.

I know it's better if such a user never came in the first place (specially if you refunded the whole amount), but it is what it is.\n[2:36 pm, 23/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: great point — how is everyone else doing this right now?\n[2:54 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 97306 69669: Add all the monthly license money we made in the last 12 months and divide by 12 = MRR\n[2:57 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: But then how do you track contraction, expansion and other key metrics?\n[2:58 pm, 23/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: 🙈\n[3:00 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 97306 69669: so we have been a zero churn business till now... so we track the number of clients we add every months, and how much License Fee money we added through those clients\n[3:01 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 97306 69669: I am getting that childhood feeling when you didnt do your homework and teacher called your name...\n[3:02 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Zero churn is ❤️ \n\n@+91 98730 02814 If you didn’t refund the money, which head would you put this in? \n\nTypically Chargebee(subscription management platforms) don’t even account this $$ in any of these heads - Neither in New MRR, nor in Churned MRR.\n[3:04 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 98730 02814: Irrespective of whether we made the refund or not, it went to both New MRR, and Churned MRR. If the same user would come back again, it's part of Reactivation MRR.\n[3:05 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 98730 02814: I am sharing this Growth Model I prepared earlier for startups to use (it's kind of a popular thing in Reforge). So, I made one that anyone can use. It has all the calculations, you can refer these.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XOg10E8YKansaitGq9yaoQ7gwj_4ADQXXEed2sWE-zc/edit?usp=sharing\n[3:07 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: typical definition of MRR is recurring revenue, so if the user is coming, paying and churning within 30 days..Should it be accounted in MRR?\n[3:12 pm, 23/05/2024] Lalit Valecha CA: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) typically includes only the revenue from customers who are expected to pay on a recurring basis. If a user pays and churns within 30 days, this revenue is not considered recurring because it does not repeat in future months. Therefore, this one-time revenue should not be included in the MRR calculation. \n\nInstead, MRR should focus on the predictable, repeatable revenue streams that come from subscriptions or other recurring billing models, excluding any one-time payments or customers who do not renew their subscription beyond the initial period.\n[3:15 pm, 23/05/2024] Lalit Valecha CA: Agree with Rohit view here as this is more one time revenue not recurring as the termination happened in first month itself.  Many companies have open offering that one can discontinue subscription in 30 days these companies also consider this as one time, hence not included in MRR And hence no churn\n[3:17 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 98998 84404: we count in new MRR and churned MRR if money is not refunded\n[3:21 pm, 23/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: @+91 98207 18028 @Pratyush Rai @+91 99200 24035 — pls chime in when you get a moment\n[3:23 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 99200 24035: If it's a $100/Mo subscription and the customer has paid for one month.\n\nWe count it as \n100 Net New MRR in M0\n100 in cancellation in M1\n[3:36 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 98207 18028: Will come under both rows: MRR Added and MRR Churned. No net movement.\n[3:37 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: Well i am in @Lalit Valecha CA’s camp here.\n[3:38 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 95436 30088: We shouldn’t be counting it as a churned or new MRR.\n[3:41 pm, 23/05/2024] +91 98207 18028: If it is getting refunded shortly after sales, best to track it under a separate row like ‘Sales Drop’ and not consider under MRR at all.\n[3:46 pm, 23/05/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: if you are a subscription only company and user signs up and pays for a plan, it gets booked at MRR. Later if the user cancels for the second months, it’s churned. If the user requests a refund and you refund it, then it doesn’t count and you can show it under some nonMRR line item.

It offers 1000$ worth of credits\n[7:45 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 98900 03352: One of the reasons could be - If your last few (in 1000s) messages didn’t get any response from the user… then meta flags accounts with such temporary limits and you should be able to reach out to them via your partner… direct contacts are slow or don’t work. \n\nI hope when you send your message you have basic response types set like - I am interested, will join, etc… at least 10% of users should ideally tap this. \n\n2: Temporary solution would be to use another number but that again won’t have your branding\n[7:46 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 98900 03352: On a side note - spoke to another BFF founder with regards to a WhatsApp issue… if WhatsApp is a significant channel for your marketing / communication purposes I strongly you work via channel partners as they usually have direct contacts with the providers\n[7:47 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 98185 62189: Thanks, very valid\n[7:48 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 98185 62189: Yes we have been using this since some time (read >year) - and have the basics in place.

They have algorithm around this both on brand quality parameters && customer intent parameters. \n\nFor us, the number of successful delivery of messages has reduced sharply on WAP (for promotional messages)\n[7:54 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 95558 55409: So a transcation message is getting 100% delivered and read. \n\n But messages for recommending creators something, is being treated as non-utility and bring selectively delivered.\n[7:58 pm, 05/06/2024] +91 98900 03352: Yes true.

This has done wonders for many portcos over the last 18 months.\n[11:43 am, 13/06/2024] Vaibhav Domkundwar: quick point: this was more about raising less and paving your own path. have no idea of the company or what it does  .. just wanted to clarify :)\n[12:19 pm, 13/06/2024] +91 98900 88420: Avinash from Zaggle is my classmate and good friend , happy to get him to speak to all of us If there is enough interest.

It was a foregone conclusion a decade ago that the only way to get campaigns to be targeted is to curate the data with human/tech process -- then the new breed like Apollo etc came in with bulk data + email + more for a low price ... they packaged stuff to make it attractive without actually fixing the data quality core.\n[4:07 pm, 14/06/2024] +91 83683 50715: https://www.clay.com/\n\nAgree with Vaibhav.
